  <h2>Plan Your Trip</h2>

  <p>"In every walk with nature, one receives far more than he seeks." - John Muir</p>

  <p>Your paper voucher opens the door to new adventures and discovery of the
  great outdoors. Our federal lands and waters provide an amazing and
  fulfilling experience with a little bit of planning.</p>

  <h3>Explore Various Destinations</h3>

  These cool trip planning tools (from our partner agencies), can help you find
  a destination. There are many federal lands and waters you can visit, and
  each presents a whole variety of activities you can do.

  <h3>Be Prepared Before You Go</h3>

  <h4>Lodging</h4>

  <p>Explore lodging options before you start out. Where you are looking for
  hotels, campgrouns or back country camping, we recommend reserving a spot
  when possible. See <a href="http://www.recreation.gov">recreation.gov</a> to
  make online reservations. 

  <h4>Packing List</h4>

  These are some essentials you should consider carrying with you. 

  <ul>
    <li>Plenty of water</li>
    <li>Snacks (high energy snacks such as trail mix and protein bars are great)</li>
    <li>A small first-aid kit</li>
    <li>Sunglasses, hat, and sunscreen (or gloves and a warm hat depending on the season)</li>
    <li>Bug repellent</li>
    <li>A map of the area and emergency numbers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You might not have cell phone coverage. For example, Glacier National Park
  is located in the mountains which are so big and remote you can't make or
  receive phone calls, texts or emails. Not all sites are like this, but it's
  best not to rely on your cell phone when you visit.</p>

  <p>Don't forget! You'll also need to bring the printed paper voucher instead
  of an electronic copy on your phone or tablet. The sites do not have the
  ability to accept electronic vouchers. Also, in some cases, you may need to
  leave the paper copy on the dashboard of your vehicle.</p>
