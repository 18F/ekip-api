        <h2>Dear Diary,</h2>

        <p> Today I went on a nature walk and saw {{selection}}. Our country has thousands of things to see 
        â€” like pine trees and prickly pears! Like lizards and bears! Like volcanoes and snowy mountains!</p>
        <p>I can't wait to use my pass to see more!</p>
