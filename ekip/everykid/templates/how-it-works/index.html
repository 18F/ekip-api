  <h1>How does it work?</h1>

  <p>It's easy! Just follow the steps shown below and you'll be visiting the
  outdoors in no time.</p>

  <h2>1</h2>

  <p>As a 4th grader, use this website to <a href="{% url "student_pass" %}">get and print</a> a voucher.</p>

  <p>Educators can <a href="{% url "educator_passes" %}">get vouchers</a> for
  their students (and download a related learning activity).</p>

  <h2>2</h2>

  <p><a href="{% url "plan_your_trip" %}">Plan a trip</a> (it's a good idea to
  involve your parents during this portion).</p>

  <p>We provide resources for educators to plan classroom field trips.</p>

  <h2>3</h2>

  <p>Exchange your voucher for a wallet-sized pass at
  <a href="{% url "pass_exchange" %}">particpating locations.</a> 
  Everywhere else, you can use
  your voucher for free entry (federal lands and waters only).</p>

  <p>Be sure to print your voucher before you go!</p>

  <h2>4</h2>

  <p>Enjoy your federal lands and waters. Leave only footsteps, take only
  pictures.</p>

  <p>Share your pictures and stories using #EveryKidInAPark</p>
  <p>And then, do it all again. Your pass is valid for up to one full year</p>

  <h2> A few things to know: </h2>

  <ul> 

    <li> Each voucher has a unique bar code. This means you can't photocopy
    your voucher and give it to your friends. However, you should encourage
    them to come here and get their own voucher if they are in the fourth
    grade.</li>

    <li>You will need to print your voucher and bring it with you. Electronic
    copies (on your phone or tablet, for example) are not accepted. At
    unstaffed locations, you'll need to leave the voucher on the dashboard of
    your car. </li>
  </ul>
