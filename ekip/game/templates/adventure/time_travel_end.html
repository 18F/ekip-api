        <h2>Dear Diary,</h2>
        <p>Today I used my free pass to explore America!</p>

        <p>At first I was nervous, because there were so many options.
        There were parks, forests, seashores, and wildlife habitats to
        visit. I had to decide what I wanted to do.</p>

        <p>I time travelled! It was so cool to see {{selection}}. And the
        best part is that this cool place belongs to me! What a great
        trip.</p>
