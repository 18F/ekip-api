        <h2>Dear Diary,</h2>

        <p>Today I used my free pass to explore America! At first I was nervous, because there were so many options. There were
        parks, forests, seashores, and wildlife habitats to visit. I had to decide
        what I wanted to do.</p>

        <p>I went on a nature walk! When I arrived, I saw {{selection}}. And the
         best part is that this cool place belongs to me! What a great trip.</p>
