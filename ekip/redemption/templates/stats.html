    <h2>About the numbers</h2> 
    
    <h3>Paper passes</h3>

    <p>Numbers for paper passes represent the number of times the Every Kid in a Park website has generated an electronic paper pass for a
    website visitor.  Website visitors include fourth-grade students, parents, and educators; they also include members of the general public
    and other visitors.</p>

    <p>The numbers reported here represent aggregate counts of the number of times an electronic paper pass have been generated.  These numbers <b>do not</b> represent:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>The number of fourth graders who have generated an electronic paper pass</li>
       <li>The number of times an electronic paper pass has been printed</li>
       <li>The number of fourth graders reached through this program</li>
       <li>For the educator workflow, the number of educators who have used the system</li>
   </ul>

    <h3>Paper passes by date range</h3>

    <p>The paper passes by date range represent a subset of the total number of passes requested through the site.  The line graph illustrates the passes
    requested by date.  Although we also identify the locations where paper passes were redeemed in the bar chart, the two graphs do not represent 
    the same data and one cannot easily be extrapolated from the other.</p>

    <h3>Exchanges</h3>

    <p>Exchanges represent the physical exchange of the printed, paper pass for the plastic pass.  These represent numbers reported
    directly by the fee collectors.</p>

    <p>These numbers represent the aggregate count of paper passes that have been reported as exchanged for plastic passes by fee collectors.  These numbers <b>do not</b> represent:</p>
        <li>The number of paper pass holders who have used the paper pass to gain entry to a federal land or water</li>
        <li>The number of fourth graders who have received a plastic pass</li>
        <li>The number of fourth graders who have exchanged a paper pass for a plastic passâ€” this number does not include numbers reported
        by Army Corps of Engineers, and it includes anyone who was able to successfully exchange the paper pass for a plastic one</li>
