<h1> Privacy statement </h1>

<h2><a href="#kids">Fourth graders</a></h2>
<p>We don't collect any information that could personally identify you. 
We do ask you to tell us the general area where you live. Knowing this helps us 
analyze who is using the program. It also helps us make your paper pass and protect against misuse.</p>

<h2><a href="#educators">Educators</a></h2>
<p>On this site, we ask you to give us some basic information. 
You're not required to provide it to us, but it's necessary to get a pass. 
We collect this information to give free passes to fourth graders and educators. 
We use it to make sure you're eligible for a free pass and to promote Every Kid in a Park. 
These passes allow free access to public lands and waters.</p>

<p>We may share the information with others, including agency groups or organizations,
pursuant to Privacy Act system of records notice DOI-6.  Among other things, 
this helps us measure and improve the program. It also helps us stop fraud and abuse.</p>
 
<p>We do all this under the authority of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act of 2004 
(REA), 16 U.S.C. 6804, and the Privacy Act, of 1974, 5 USC 552.</p>
