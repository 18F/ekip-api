            <h1><span>Dear Diary,</span></h1>
            <p>Today I used my free pass to explore America!</p>

            <p>At first I was nervous, because there were so many options. There were
            parks, forests, seashores, and wildlife habitats to visit. I had to decide
            what I wanted to do.</p>

            <p>I went swimming! I could hardly wait to jump into that fresh, cold
            {{selection}}. And the best part is that this cool place belongs to me!
            What a great trip.</p>
