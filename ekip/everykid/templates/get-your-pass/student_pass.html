    <h1>Start your outdoor adventure right now</h1>
    <p>Play a game and discover all the wonderful places you can go. After the game, you can print a voucher for free access to your federal lands and waters.</p>
    <p>This voucher can then be exchanged for your free 4th grade pass (a more durable, and smaller version) at many federal lands and waters (don't worry, we'll tell you where).</p>
