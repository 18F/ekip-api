    <h2> Dear Diary, </h2>

    <p>
        Today I used my free pass to explore America!
    </p>

    <p> At first I was nervous, because there were so many options. There were
    parks, forests, seashores, and wildlife habitats to visit.</p>

    <p> I had to decide what I wanted to do: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="{% url 'adventure_nature_walk' %}"><button>I went on a nature walk!</button></a></li>
        <li><a href="{% url 'adventure_time_travel' %}"><button>I time traveled!</button></a></li>
        <li><a href="{% url 'adventure_swimming' %}"><button>I went swimming!</button></a></li>
    </ul>
    </div>
{% endblock content %}
