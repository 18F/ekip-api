        <h2>Dear Diary,</h2>
        <p>Today I used my free pass to explore America!</p>

        <p>At first I was nervous, because there were so many options. There were
        parks, forests, seashores, and wildlife habitats to visit. I had to decide
        what I wanted to do.</p>

        <p>I went swimming! I could hardly wait to jump into that fresh, cold
        {{selection}}. And the best part is that this cool place belongs to me!
        What a great trip.</p>
