  <ul>
      <li> Camping. 
      <li> Fishing. 
      <li> Hiking through the forest. 
      <li> Riding your bike along a river. 
      <li> Watching whales. 
      <li> Learning about the history and culture of our nation.
      <li> Visiting a dinosaur. 
      <li> Or laying down on the ground, and seeing millions of stars at night. 
  </ul>

  <p> These are just a few of the things you can do on your federal lands and
  waters. </p>

  <p> Caring for your national resources is important. Because of this, we
  often charge visitors money when they come to federal lands and waters.
  However, as a 4th grader, you can get a pass that allows you and your car
  load to visit for free and start your next adventure. </p>

      <p>Play a game to earn your pass.</p>
